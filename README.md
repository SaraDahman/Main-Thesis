## Project Idea description.

The idea of the project came as a solution to the problem of wasted food from resturants by refactoring the food into valid meals
for people such as college students, people who cant afford expensive food and to provide food for startups and small companies. Also, to prevent resturants from throwing away extra food.
Another use for our website is to provide a platform for home businesses to manage the selling and displaying of their meals. 

## Features or use cases or user stories.

The two main Users of our webiste are a User or a client and a Business owner.
The client can display the meals from the three nearest, cheapset or most rated resturants or any resturant on google maps. Also, select the prefered payment method alongside with the drop off location.
Regarding business owners, they can open up their resturant pages where they can offer, delete or modify meals with notifications regarding the processes and all the status of their meals and customers.
